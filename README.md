## The Guide
Minecraft modding is very simple. Just make sure you don't download from the wrong places. 
This guide is meant to guide you in not only modding with modpacks and individual mods but to even play with friends without buying a server. Minecraft modding is meant to be free so do not listen to any ads saying to buy a server so you can play with friends. 
This guide will be split into multiple sections for your ease of access. I will split it:
1. [Introduction to modding in minecraft](#user-content-introduction-to-modding-in-minecraft)
2. [Modpacks](#user-content-modpacks)
3. Playing with friends
4. Extras

### Introduction to modding in minecraft 


Modding is very easy but without the correct sites it can become a hassle. 
The first step is to pick a Mod Loader.
The more popular otptions are always [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)
But there are more[...](https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Modloaders)
These two are used the most and have different purposes, which means there is no best one. It really just depends on what you want. Forge is more heavy loaded and can handle more mods. While Fabric is more proformace based is faster loading.

After intalling a mod loader make sure you click on the installer to set the mods folder to \AppData\Roaming\.minecraft
On there you will put your mods
if you need to find mods there are couple of websites you can use.
The two most popular are [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft)


Now you are set to play
Open up the mincraft launcher
Click instilations
You should see your loader's intallation there
if not click new intallation and type out the loader

### Modpacks

If moding could be any easier then modpack would be your solution.
The previous section talked about individual mods installed one by one, but if you ever want to play bunched together mods without breaking your pc then ModPacks are best. 

ModPacks are simple. All you have to do is download a launcher to do all the work or if you want to do it manually there is always that option, but that is not recomended. 

There are two major modpack launchers out there. [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft)

Modrinth allows for direct download of the modpacks whilst CurseForge does not.
Both launchers are here [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)

### Playing with friends

Minecraft java is always a pain in the butt to play with friends. Java limits you to either servers hosted by you or thrid-parties or local lan play. But hold on can't you host a server yourself and play with friends. Yes, but most of the time it cost money or it is extremely slow for free users. Hosting locally works too but that can be annoying to set up. 
So either pay or have a slow server. 
Welp where this a free market there is glory.

With mods
just mod minecraft to have friends for you. 
[Essential](https://essential.gg/) is one such mod. 

Now you can be free of your lonley burden. 
You can even add it to modpacks just allow content modifications on your modpack launcher and add this mod.
